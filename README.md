These R Shiny scripts and re-formatted data files are in support the amazing project, Who's Making News: https://www.whoismakingnews.com/

The initial intent of these scripts was to (1) teach myself Shiny, and (2) make some interesting analyses/visualizations for looking at data and support the cause.  

Other standard analyses of these data could be found elsewhere (rates per capita, etc.), but what struck me as interesting after a quick look through the data was the preponderance of male names associated with sex crimes against children.  I wanted to be able to emphasize this information.
